Requirements
------------

You need Python 3.6 or later to run GriSPy. You can have multiple Python
versions (2.x and 3.x) installed on the same system without problems.


Installation
------------

The easiest way to install is using pip::

    $ pip install grispy

This will install the latest stable version on PIPy.

If you want to use the latest development version from github, unpack or clone the `repo <https://github.com/mchalela/GriSPy>`_ on your local machine,
change the directory to where setup.py is, and install using setuptools::

    $ python setup.py install

or pip::

    $ pip install -e .
